        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
           <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
           <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
           <li>2 large eggs</li>
           <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
           <li>Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and fluffy.</li>
           <li>Add Eggs: Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
           <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
           <li>Mix Dry and Wet Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
           <li>Add Chocolate Chips: Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
           <li>Scoop Cookies: Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
           <li>Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked; they will continue to cook as they cool.</li>
           <li>Cool: Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
           <li>Enjoy: Serve warm or store in an airtight container for later enjoyment.</li>
        </ol>
