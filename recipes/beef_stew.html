        <p>
            Beef stew is a hearty and comforting dish made by slow-cooking tender chunks of beef with a variety of vegetables and flavorful broth.
            This classic meal is perfect for chilly days, as it warms you from the inside out.
            The beef becomes melt-in-your-mouth tender, while the vegetables absorb the rich flavors of the stew.
            It's a one-pot meal that’s easy to prepare and is often even better the next day!

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Brown the Beef: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes in batches, browning them on all sides. Remove the browned beef and set aside.</li>
           <li>Sauté Onions and Garlic: In the same pot, add the chopped onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
           <li>Add Broth and Seasonings: Return the browned beef to the pot. Pour in the beef broth and add the tomato paste, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
           <li>Add Vegetables: Add the carrots, potatoes, and celery to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
           <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it she last 10 minutes of cooking.</li>
           <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
           <li>Serve: Remove the bay leaf before serving. Ladle the beef stew into bowls and enjoy it hot, ideally with crusty bread or over rice.</li>
