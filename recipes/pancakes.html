            Pancakes are a classic breakfast favorite that are fluffy, light, and delicious.
            They are made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder, cooked on a griddle or skillet until golden brown.
            Pancakes can be served with a variety of toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or chocolate chips,
            making them a versatile and satisfying meal to start your day.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter (plus extra for cooking)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, mix the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine Mixtures: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
            <li>Preheat Skillet: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter to coat the surface.</li>
            <li>Cook Pancakes: Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip and Cook: Carefully flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve: Remove the pancakes from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
